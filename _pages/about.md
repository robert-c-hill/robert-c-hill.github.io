About Me
======
Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Earth and Climate Sciences at Duke University. I currently work in the [Vengosh Lab Group](https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/avnervengosh/) where we conduct research within various applications of geochemistry. My current research is two-fold and housed in the sub-field of isotope geochemistry. I study the isotope geochemistry of phosphate rocks and fertilizers, for reconstructing paleo-ocean conditions of phosphate rock formation and as potential tracers of trace metals associated with fertilizer application. Outside of research, I enjoy learning German, pampering my cat, doing DIY home renovations with my partner, and being active.

Looking Forward
======
I am interested in the many applications of isotope geochemistry. My existing body of research consists of isotope geochemistry applications from deep-time earth systems to contemporary anthropogenically impacted modern systems. However, the applications of isotope chemistry extend far beyond geological and environmental sciences. Following completion of my PhD program in spring 2026, I am interested in pursuing post-doctoral study in isotope metallomics (application of isotopes in health sciences).
