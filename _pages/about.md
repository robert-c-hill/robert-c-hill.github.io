About Me
======
Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Earth and Climate Sciences at Duke University. I currently work in the [Vengosh Lab Group](https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/avnervengosh/) where we conduct research within various applications of geochemistry. My current research is two-fold and housed in the sub-field of isotope geochemistry. I study the isotope geochemistry of phosphate rocks and fertilizers, for reconstructing paleo-ocean conditions of phosphate rock formation and as potential tracers of trace metals associated with fertilizer application. I currently teach an ECS 390 course, titled Freshwater Biogeochemistry: Processes and Human Impacts. Outside of research and teaching, I enjoy trying out new recipes, pampering my cat, doing DIY home renovations, and winning at pickeleball.

Looking Forward
======
I am interested in the many applications of isotope geochemistry. My existing body of research consists of isotope geochemistry applications from deep-time earth systems to contemporary anthropogenically impacted modern systems. However, the applications of isotope chemistry extend far beyond geological and environmental sciences and I am interested in extending collaborations to research in the field of isotope metallomics (application of isotopes in health sciences).
