<p>Geoscience is an extremely engaging field of science that pulls expertise from various disciplines (such as physics, chemistry, and biology) to describe complex modern and ancient systems. It is inherently interdisciplinary in nature and provides students the opportunity to learn by interacting with their natural world. This is what first drew me to geoscience; the opportunity to use the geological systems in my community to develop a personal understanding of geological processes. Now as both a researcher and instructor, I bring a translational perspective to my teaching, where I intentionally design courses integrating varied qualitative and quantitative modes of thinking to make basic geoscience concepts more accessible.</p>

<p>During my years as a teaching assistant and into my role as an instructor, I have been continuously impressed by how the diverse perspectives and experiences of my students create a unique, sustained learning community. Central to my teaching philosophy is cultivating this supportive learning community where I implement collaborative learning, systems thinking, and research experiences to maximize student interest, engagement, and confidence as interpreters of their natural world.</p>

<p>My teaching development began during my undergraduate career at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where I participated in a two-semester pedagogical training program that emphasized classroom management, leadership, and inclusive instructional design. Through this experience, I independently facilitated a first-year seminar and developed structured lesson plans centered on student discussion and reflection. Concurrently, as a laboratory assistant for the Department of Chemistry’s lecture courses, I designed and prepared lecture demonstrations that translated abstract chemical principles into tangible, observable processes. These early experiences solidified my commitment to active, demonstration-driven learning.</p>

<p>I later served as an instructor in <a href="https://merit.illinois.edu/about-merit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois’ Merit Program</a>, which emphasizes equitable, high-engagement instruction in STEM courses. Under the mentorship of a faculty instructor, I taught small sections of introductory chemistry which allowed me to tailor instruction to diverse student needs and to implement structured active-learning strategies. Through iterative problem-solving sessions and collaborative exercises, my students demonstrated measurable improvement in exam performance relative to larger lecture sections. This experience reinforced my belief that intentional course design and close instructor-student interaction can significantly improve conceptual understanding.</p>

<p>During my doctoral training at Duke University, I expanded my instructional scope through guest lectures in environmental and water science courses and through completion of a Graduate Certificate in College Teaching. In addition to lectures on foundational geoscience concepts and field and analytical methods, I designed and delivered a lecture on coal energy and its effects on local communities structured around a “lifecycle” framework. In this session, students traced coal from its geological formation through extraction, combustion, atmospheric emissions, and contamination pathways, culminating in case studies from North Carolina and broader U.S. energy policy. By framing this topic as an interconnected system, from geological processes to environmental and legislative consequences, I encouraged students to synthesize geological, chemical, and societal dimensions of energy production. I intentionally connect course material to students’ local communities and contemporary global issues so that abstract environmental principles become tangible and relevant.</p>

<p>At Duke University, I voluntarily assisted in an undergraduate capstone course focused on the geology of Ireland, in which students integrated their cumulative geoscience education, from plate tectonics to stratigraphy, through initial classroom preparation and field investigation abroad. This experience reinforced my commitment to experiential learning and utilizing the power of boots-on-the-ground instruction in deepening conceptual understanding. I have continued this approach in the upper-division undergraduate course I co-developed and currently co-teach, Freshwater Biogeochemistry: Processes and Human Impacts, which integrates traditional instruction with research-based learning. Students engage with primary literature, conduct field sampling or laboratory analysis, and complete independent projects grounded in their local environment. Throughout this course, I utilize local watersheds (e.g., Ellerbe Creek and Falls Lake Basin) to exemplify learned concepts. By structuring the course around both systems thinking and authentic investigation, I aim to connect foundational knowledge to independent scientific practice. </p>

<summary><span style="font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: 700;">Philosophy and Student Engagement</span></summary>

<p>From my experience in the Geology of Ireland and Freshwater Biogeochemistry courses, I have found that geoscience attracts students from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds. To foster student engagement utilizing these diverse disciplinary perspectives, I prioritize developing a shared language in the classroom, ensuring that all students can recognize and integrate multiple approaches to understanding natural phenomena. In my Freshwater Biogeochemistry course, I structure class sessions to move intentionally from qualitative conceptual discussions to quantitative analysis. Beginning with descriptive and process-based reasoning allows students who may be less comfortable with mathematics to build confidence, while still challenging their peers as we progressively introduce the rigorous quantitative framework. Through this iterative approach, students develop the tools necessary to interpret their natural environment with increasing independence. </p>

<p>I also incorporate structured peer-to-class discussion as a mode for students to pool ideas to deepen conceptual understanding. For example, when teaching water-rock interactions, I provided student pairs with elemental chemistry data and asked them to infer the subsurface processes responsible for the observed patterns. We then refined these interpretations collectively as a class to strengthen our understanding of water-rock interactions. Rather than presenting answers directly, this approach encouraged students to reason from evidence, articulate interpretations, and refine their thinking through collaborative dialogue. </p>

<p>While such high-engagement modalities are most natural in small courses, I intend to adapt similar principles for larger classes through a hybrid structure that combines preparatory reading, focused mini-lectures, and iterative in-class problem solving. This provides students with structured opportunities to reinforce foundational concepts while applying and synthesizing ideas. As a Merit instructor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, I used this approach to provide students with an enriching learning experience: short, targeted lectures reinforce core concepts introduced in preparatory readings, and are followed by breakout-group exercises that guide students through iterative practice problems tailored in sequence to assess student’s ability to understand and apply key concepts. This format maintains accountability and instructional coverage while preserving opportunities for active engagement. </p>

<p>In my Freshwater Biogeochemistry course, I incorporated a real-time environmental event by collecting water samples immediately before and repeatedly after a snowstorm so that students could analyze the chemical response and recovery of a surface water system to storm-driven natural and anthropogenic inputs. Integrating such real-world events into coursework reflects my commitment to facilitating opportunities for students to engage with their local environmental systems. At Union College, I am particularly excited by the involvement of field and laboratory experiences in courses; a practice which bridges learning and application to support student development into a practicing geoscientist. Given Union’s proximity to the Mohawk River, I envision opportunities to examine tributary chemistry or exposed stratigraphy arising from stream cuts as integrate experiences in courses or independent undergraduate research. The Middle Ordovician stratigraphy of the Mohawk Valley provides a local context for teaching sedimentology and stratigraphy, allowing students to examine how geological events, such as the Taconic orogeny, are recorded in the stratigraphic record. </p>

<p>These approaches reflect my commitment to an inclusive, experiential teaching philosophy. By combining iterative instruction, collaborative learning, and local geological examples and investigations, I aim to help students develop confidence as capable interpreters of the natural world and as active participants in the geosciences.</p>
